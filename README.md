<h1 align="center">How to build aurorachat</h1>

Install devkitpro with the Switch development libraries and make, then execute the following commands based on your OS:

Windows:
```sh
pacman -S switch-harfbuzz switch-freetype switch-bzip2 switch-libpng switch-zlib switch-curl switch-mbedtls switch-sdl2_mixer libnx
git clone https://github.com/Unitendo/aurorachat-switch
cd aurorachat-switch
make
```

Arch Linux or other distros with pacman:
```sh
yay -S devkitpro-pacman
sudo dkp-pacman -S switch-harfbuzz switch-freetype switch-bzip2 switch-libpng switch-zlib switch-curl switch-mbedtls switch-sdl2_mixer libnx
git clone https://github.com/Unitendo/aurorachat-switch
cd aurorachat-switch
make
```

Other Linux distros without pacman:
```sh
sudo dkp-pacman -S switch-harfbuzz switch-freetype switch-bzip2 switch-libpng switch-zlib switch-curl switch-mbedtls switch-sdl2_mixer libnx
git clone https://github.com/Unitendo/aurorachat-switch
cd aurorachat-switch
make
```

(At least that's what I think you gotta do)

## Troubleshooting
*When using AuroraChat on the switch, you may run into some problems, or error screens. These all have different meanings.*
There are three possibilities on why you may get an error:
1. The server is down or unreachable
2. You have a bad internet connection
3. An internal error occurred
